# QuickMacro

**QuickMacro** is a Python tool for recording and replaying mouse and keyboard actions.  
It uses the [`keyboard`](https://pypi.org/project/keyboard/) and [`mouse`](https://pypi.org/project/mouse/) libraries to capture user input and simulate playback.

** Strictly a automation tool; Do not attempt to use for games (it won't work anyways) **

## Features
- **Record** mouse and keyboard actions simultaneously
- **Playback** recordings at adjustable speeds  
- (Hypothetially) Cross Platform
- Mouse animation on X11 (Linux)  

> Note that on linux, the script requires sudo (to access inputs without being X11 dependant) and on mac requires granting accessibility permissions to terminal/python in System Preferences -> Security & Privacy

## Installation

Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/QuickMacro.git
cd QuickMacro
```
Install dependencies:

```
pip install keyboard mouse
```
## Usage
QuickMacro provides a command-line interface (CLI) to record and playback actions.
It is recommended to save the command such that it runs via a hotkey of your design in your system settings. (so a hotkey to record and a hotkey to play)
